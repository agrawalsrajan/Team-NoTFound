# MARKER-LESS MOTION CAPTURE by Team-NoTFound
Problem Statement: 
Traditional body tracking systems rely on costly markers and specialized hardware, 
limiting accessibility. There is a growing need for a marker-less, AI-driven solution to 
accurately capture and translate body movements into digital environments, catering to 
beginners and professionals in animation and real-time applications. 

Project Aim:  
The project focuses on developing an AI-powered, marker-less body tracking system 
that captures real-time human movements using a device's camera and translates 
them into precise, fluid actions on a 3D digital avatar. Utilizing advanced machine 
learning techniques, this system enables users to control the avatar's movements 
seamlessly, offering smooth interactions for applications in animation, gaming, and 
virtual reality. By leveraging Generative AI and GAIT analysis, the solution integrates 
features like frame generation, pose correction, and preset animations, making it an 
accessible tool for creators and developers to transform body motion into digital 
experiences effortlessly.
